# Project---Distracted-Driver-Detection
The distracted driver detection deep learning project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify drivers who are distracted while driving using a 
combination of CNN, Maxpooling and Dense Layers.
The model is trained on a large dataset of images of distracted and attentive drivers and can detect a variety of distractions such as texting, 
eating, and drinking. The project has the potential to improve road safety by alerting drivers and authorities of potentially dangerous situations
